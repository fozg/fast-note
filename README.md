This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Idea
[\[f\]/fastNote](https://fozg.net/fastnote) inspired by FBMessenger, when I always messages to myself to copy some text, link even an image between 
my devices.

So what's different from FBMessger ?
## Feature
- Same UI with FBMessenger, look like a self conversation, that mean you dont need to learn how to use.
- Dont need to search myself like FBMessenger.
- Ez to manage by color tag.
- Auto copy on recive new `FastNote` from other device feature.
- Keep styling of content that you copy from a web.

## Limitation
- Not support Image yet.
